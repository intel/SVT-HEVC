The Scalable Video Technology for HEVC Encoder (SVT-HEVC Encoder) is an HEVC-compliant encoder library core that achieves excellent density-quality tradeoffs, and is highly optimized for Intel® Xeon™ Scalable Processor and Xeon™ D processors.

The whitepaper for SVT-HEVC can be found here: https://01.org/svt

This encoder has been optimized to achieve excellent performance levels using 13 density-quality presets (please refer to the user guide for more details) on a system with a dual Intel® Xeon® Scalable CPU targeting:

-  Real-time encoding of up to one 8Kp60/10-bit streams on the Platinum 8180 with M11 in the visual quality mode

-  Real-time encoding of up to two 8Kp50/10-bit streams on the Platinum 8180 with M12 in the visual quality mode

-  Real-time encoding of up to four 4Kp60/10-bit streams on the Gold 6148 with M12 in the visual quality mode

-  Real-time encoding of up to six 4Kp60/10-bit streams on the Platinum 8180 with M12 in the visual quality mode

SVT-HEVC Encoder also supports 3 modes:

-  A visually optimized mode for visual quality (-tune 0)

-  An PSNR/SSIM optimized mode for PSNR / SSIM benchmarking (-tune 1 (Default setting))

-  An VMAF optimized mode for VMAF benchmarking (-tune 2)

The encoder can also run the ABR profile below on one Intel® Xeon-D™ D-2191:


|       ABR Profile         | 
|---------------------------------------|
|   1 x 4kp60/10-bit Stream	(@M11)      |
|   1 x 1080p60/10-bit Stream (@M10)    |
|   1 x 720p60/8-bit Stream	(@M9)       |
|   1 x 480p60/8-bit Stream	(@M9)       |
|   1 x 360p60/8-bit Stream	(@M9)       |

# System Requirements

## Operating System

SVT-HEVC may run on any Windows* or Linux* 64 bit operating systems. The list below represents the operating systems that the encoder application and library were tested and validated on:

* __Windows* Operating Systems (64-bit):__

    -  Windows* Server 2016

* __Linux* Operating Systems (64-bit):__

    -  Ubuntu* 16.04 Server LTS

    -  Ubuntu* 18.04 Server LTS

## Hardware

The SVT-HEVC Encoder library supports x86 architecture

* __CPU Requirements__

In order to achieve the performance targeted by the encoder, the specific CPU model listed above would need to be used when running the encoder. Otherwise, the encoder runs on any 5th Generation Intel Core™ Processors (formerly Broadwell) CPUs (Xeon E5-v4) or newer.

* __RAM Requirements__

In order to run the highest resolution supported by the encoder, at least 64GB of RAM is required to run a single 8kp50/10-bit encode. The encoder application will display an error if the system does not have enough RAM to support such. The following table shows the minimum amount of RAM required for some standard resolutions of 10bit video per stream:


|       Resolution      | Minimum Footprint (GB)|
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
|      8k               |           64          |
|      4k               |           16          |
|      1080p            |           6           |
|      720p/1080i       |           4           |
|      480p             |           3           |

# Demo features and limitations

-  **VBR BRC mode:** The VBR functionality implemented in SVT-HEVC Encoder is a demo feature to allow for an easier integration of product level BRC. The algorithm implemented would allow the encoder to generate an output bit stream matching, with a best effort, the target bitrate. The algorithm does not guarantee a certain maximum bitrate or maximum buffer size [does not follow HRD compliance]. When set to encode in VBR mode, the encoder does not produce a bit-exact output from one run to another.

-  **Speed Control output:** The speed control functionality implemented for SVT-HEVC Encoder is a demo feature showcasing the capability of the library to adapt to the resources available on the fly in order to generate the best possible video quality while maintaining a real-time encoding speed. When set to use the Speed Control mode, the encoder does not produce a bit-exact output from one run to another.

-  **Multi-instance support:** The multi-instance functionality is a demo feature implemented in the SVT-HEVC Encoder sample application as an example of one sample application using multiple encoding libraries. Encoding using the multi-instance support is limited to only 6 simultaneous streams. For example two channels encoding on Windows: SvtHevcEncApp.exe -nch 2 -c firstchannel.cfg secondchannel.cfg
